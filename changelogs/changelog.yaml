      bugfixes:
      - Integration tests to test support of AWS, Azure and GCP.
      - Several integration tests were added to test end-to-end behaviour.
      deprecated_features:
      - state=planned is deprecated. Use check_mode=true at the module level instead.
      major_changes:
      - Added the git_plan role to apply a Terraform plan stored in a Git repository.
      - Added the inventory_from_outputs role to construct an in-memory inventory
        from Terraform outputs.
      - Added the terraform_output module which parses values from terraform outputs.
      - Check mode now works as intended and produces correct "changed" output and
        results.
      minor_changes:
      - Slight code reorganization to always run terraform plan, and then optionally
        apply the generated plan.
