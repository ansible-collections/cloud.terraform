      major_changes:
        - Added search_child_modules option to terraform_provider inventory plugin.
        - Allow project_path in terraform_provider inventory plugin to accept a list of paths.
      minor_changes:

  1.1.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Integration tests to test support of AWS, Azure and GCP.
      - Major refactoring of the cloud.terraform collection, restructuring and compartmentalizing
        code.
      - Removed "mutually exclusive" condition for state_file and project_path in
        inventory_from_outputs role, since terraform_output module doesn't require
        this. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/39)
      - Several integration tests were added to test end-to-end behaviour.
      - Terraform module - fix now allows the possibility that the key "value" is
        not always present in the terraform plan thus avoiding KeyError. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/45)
      - Terraform module - fix now expands the providers schema with block_types section
        so when checking if (block) attribute is sensitive in providers schema KeyError
        is now avoided. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/46)
      - Terraform_output - fix now sets "outputs" variable to None in case of TerraformWarning
        to avoid undefined variable error. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/31)
      - Type hints added to the cloud.terraform collection for easier future maintenance
        and reliability.
      - Updated host and group name in cloud.terraform.terraform_provider inventory
        plugin. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/34)
      - terraform_output module - when providing name and state_file parameters, the
        value of the requested output wasn't returned. This issue was solved by changing
        the order of the name and state parameters in the invoked Terraform command
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/19).
      deprecated_features:
      - state=planned is deprecated. Use check_mode=true at the module level instead.
      major_changes:
      - Added the git_plan role to apply a Terraform plan stored in a Git repository.
      - Added the inventory_from_outputs role to construct an in-memory inventory
        from Terraform outputs.
      - Added the terraform_output module which parses values from terraform outputs.
      - Check mode now works as intended and produces correct "changed" output and
        results.
      - Inventory plugin cloud.terraform.terraform_provider added. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/22)
      - Support diff mode in cloud.terraform.terraform both in check mode and in non-check
        mode. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/11)
      - Terraform output lookup module added (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/12).
      minor_changes:
      - Removed "required_one_of" condition from terraform_output module. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/31).
      - Slight code reorganization to always run terraform plan, and then optionally
        apply the generated plan.
      - Terraform output lookup module - documentation for state_file option updated.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/29).
      - git_plan and inventory_from_outputs role's argument_spec.yml updated to be
        able to generate documentation (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/28)
      - meta/runtime.yml - Drop space in requires_ansible that was preventing the
        upload on Galaxy (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/8).
