      - Added the git_plan role to apply a Terraform plan stored in a Git repository.
      - Added the inventory_from_outputs role to construct an in-memory inventory
        from Terraform outputs.
      - Added the terraform_output module which parses values from terraform outputs.

        results.
      minor_changes:
      - Slight code reorganization to always run terraform plan, and then optionally
        apply the generated plan.
