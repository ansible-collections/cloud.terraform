- Added the terraform_output module which parses values from terraform outputs.

Minor Changes
-------------

Deprecated Features
-------------------

Bugfixes
--------

- Integration tests to test support of AWS, Azure and GCP.
- Major refactoring of the cloud.terraform collection, restructuring and compartmentalizing code.
- Removed "mutually exclusive" condition for state_file and project_path in inventory_from_outputs role, since terraform_output module doesn't require this. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/39)
- Several integration tests were added to test end-to-end behaviour.
- Terraform module - fix now allows the possibility that the key "value" is not always present in the terraform plan thus avoiding KeyError. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/45)
- Terraform module - fix now expands the providers schema with block_types section so when checking if (block) attribute is sensitive in providers schema KeyError is now avoided. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/46)
- Terraform_output - fix now sets "outputs" variable to None in case of TerraformWarning to avoid undefined variable error. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/31)
- Type hints added to the cloud.terraform collection for easier future maintenance and reliability.
- Updated host and group name in cloud.terraform.terraform_provider inventory plugin. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/34)
- terraform_output module - when providing name and state_file parameters, the value of the requested output wasn't returned. This issue was solved by changing the order of the name and state parameters in the invoked Terraform command (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud.terraform/pull/19).
